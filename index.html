            height="40%">
        <p> Mehndi is the art of applying henna to the skin to create temporary tattoos. The word mehndi means "henna"
            in Hindi, and the art itself can be referred to as mehendi, mehandi, al-henna, or just henna. The henna
            paste is all natural, and is applied to the skin using a mehndi cone. Once the henna is dried and removed,
            it leaves a dark red or black stain behind. Henna tattoos are temporary, but can last for up to three weeks.

            A traditional form of body art, mehndi originates in India, the Middle East, and North Africa. The tradition
            began with the application of henna to soften and condition the skin and was later used to create body art
            for special occasions, such as festivals or weddings. The application of henna to create temporary tattoos
            has since spread the world over and is quickly gaining popularity in the Western world as well.

            Henna tattoos are created using a natural henna paste made from the henna, Hawsonia inermis, shrub. The
            leaves and twigs are ground into a fine powder, which is the main ingredient. There are many recipes for
            making henna powder, and the ingredients added can vary depending on the supplier or manufacturer.

            In order to make the henna paste, the mehndi artist mixes the henna powder with water. Some artists prefer
            to add lemon juice to create a darker stain. The paste is scooped into a mehndi cone, which works in much
            the same way as an icing bag. The paste is then squeezed onto the skin, and can be used to create very
            intricate and elaborate designs.</p>
